## This is using MDX-deck
to render these slides

## You can use

`markdown`

to create the content

# Presenter mode
### You can have notes that can only be seen in "presenter mode"
#### (alt + P)
<Notes>
This note can only be seen by you, not your audience
</Notes>
---
# Pro tip
- Open two browser windows
- one with the "presenter mode"
- and the other in "normal mode",
- then use meets/hangouts/zoom to present the normal one 
- look at the other window for your cheatsheet

### both will sync when you change the slide
<Notes>
and you can use this as a cheat sheet when you are presenting
</Notes>
---
### This is a React component

<Counter/>
<Notes>
  Sadly any interactive component like this one
  won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.

export default BlankTemplate

<CodeSurfer
  title="You can also view code"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/property-values.css")}
  lang="css"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    { lines: [6], notes: 'You can zoom in'},
    { lines: [3, 11, 18], notes: 'select many lines'},
    { range: [9,15], notes: 'or even a range of lines' },
    { tokens: { 17: [1, 6] }, notes: 'also specific tokens' }
  ]}
/>

<Codepen 
  title="Demo time!"
  label="Open"
  url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/NBPWZp"/>
<Notes>
  This is a working codepen,
  be careful when clicking the sides as you might change the slide accidentally.
  Also it won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.
