# What is Vue.js?

<Notes>
Ok so what is Vue.js

--- Ask the audience to see if they want to answer...

</Notes>

## Vue.js is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.

<Appear>
  <p>but..., what does progressive framework means?</p>
</Appear>

<Notes>Before answering that, I want to make a poll</Notes>

<Notes>--- Ask to raise their hand for each framework they've used</Notes>

<Notes>
Now getting back to what is a progressive framework, these are the
frameworks but ordered by how many decisions they've made for you.

The frameworks to the right, already have a lot of tools that solve a bunch of problems in web development.

The ones on the left have very few tools, like just the basic tools render a web page.

</Notes>

<Notes>
By the way, jQuery is way over there to the left, because it is not even a template engine.

Anyways, what makes a framework progressive, is the flexibility it gives you to allow
you to add libraries as your project grows, and let you make your own decisions on what to use.

</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate;

![](./slides/images/progressive_003.png)

<Notes>
So probably you are wondering which of those 2 you should use, and I'd say it depends on the situation.

There is not something like the best framework overall

# How Vue.js works?

<Notes>Ok, se let's see how Vue.js works and what is so cool about it</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate;

![](./slides/images/separation.png)

<Notes>
When we usually make a site we create the elements in out page with HTML

Then we style them with CSS so they look nice

And any interaction we need in our website is done in separate Javascript files, right?

</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate;

![](./slides/images/vue-separation.png)

<Notes>
But Vue.js changes this separation of concerns.

Instead of thinking template, styles and interactions we can think in components,
for example a button, a list, a navbar, footer, etc

Each one of these having their own structure, style and interactions.

</Notes>

<Notes>You can think of them as lego blocks</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate;

![](./slides/images/home-legos.png)

<Notes>
  So when you build your website you can identify all those elements and make a
  component out of it
</Notes>

export default BlankTemplate;

<CodeSurfer
  title="This is how a .vue file looks"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/example.vue")}
  lang="css"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    { range: [1, 5], notes: "this is the template or HTML part" },
    { range: [6, 15], notes: "this is the behaviour or the JS part" },
    { range: [16, 21], notes: "this is the style or the CSS part" },
    { range: [1, 21], notes: "" }
  ]}

### How Vue.js

# RENDERING

### works?

<Notes>
  now for the difficult part, let's see how Vue.js renders a component
</Notes>

---

export default BlankTemplate;

![](./slides/images/two-way.png)

<Notes>
  probably you won't understand this diagram at first (I didn't), but basically
  it is the way Vue.js knows that something changed in the application and need
  to render again your page
</Notes>

## Let's add Vue.js to an "existing" project

<Codepen label="Open" url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/ywoMqE" />

---

# Create a new project with Vue CLI

---

## Install Vue CLI

# https://cli.vuejs.org/

---

# Make a To Do list app

---

# Clone the repo
