<Codepen 
  title="Adding Vue.js to a site"
  label="Open"
  url="https://codepen.io/ederdiaz/pen/ywoMqE"/>
<Notes>
  This is a working codepen,
  be careful when clicking the sides as you might change the slide accidentally.
  Also it won't change it's state in both windows,
  any demo should be worked on the "normal mode" window.
