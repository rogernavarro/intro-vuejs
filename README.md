# Intro to Vue.js

A Wizeline Academy workshop for Web Development using VueJS

## Creating a new Vue project

This repository already has a Vue.js project created with the Vue CLi. The following are the steps that you need to create a new one from scratch:

- Install [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

> ```bash
> npm install -g @vue/cli-service-global
> # or
> yarn global add @vue/cli-service-global
> ```

- For a setup with a graphical interface run `vue ui`
- For a setup with a command line interface run `vue create <project-name>`

## Workshop Slides

The slides used in this workshop are contained in the `slides/` folder. In order to view them you need to do the following:

- Navigate to the slides folder with `cd slides`
- Use a package manager to install the dependencies, yarn is recommended:
  > ```bash
  > yarn
  > # or
  > npm install
  > ```
- If everything installed correctly you should be able to run the `start` command:
  > ```bash
  > yarn start
  > # or
  > npm run start
  > ```
- The slides should open in a new window in your browser

To finish running the slides interrupt the process (for example `ctrl + c`)
